## Welcome to this website!!!

This is the website for the USDA Peach Rootstock Lab led by Jeekin Lau. Jeekin obtained his PhD at Texas A&M University in the department of Horticulture in the area of plant breeding and quantitative genetics. A little about  myself, I studied polyploid genetics in a highly heterozygous auto-polyploid perennial crop garden roses and had the opportunity to learn many genomics approaches to help traditional plant breeders make informed decisions.

Along the way throughout my PhD I have become more computational and am an active contributor to the [Tools for Polyploid](https://www.polyploids.org/) USDA SCRI grant. I am also a contributor to some of the software that are connected to this grant [MAPpoly](https://github.com/mmollina/MAPpoly) and [onemap](https://github.com/Cristianetaniguti/onemap).  

We will use this site as a way to disperse news and ongoing research happening within the lab.
