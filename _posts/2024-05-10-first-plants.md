## First Plants Going in Greenhouse
To test the misting bench I took some cuttings of hydrangeas and some peach rootstocks. It's been a while since I did softwood cuttings and took off way too much leaf material. below are some pictures of the first round of plants roughly taken 2 weeks ago. 

 Hydrangeas (left), Peach rootstock softwood cuttings that don't look too well (middle), Peach rootstock softwood cuttings that look good so far(right).
