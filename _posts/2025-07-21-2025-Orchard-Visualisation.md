## Orchard Tree Visualizer webapp
To help with the planting of my first 5 acre peach orchard, I needed some guidance in respect to how to layout an orchard in a given field space. The need of needing to visualize a orchard layout gave rise to an idea of developing a web application to design a orchard layout, export the layout to an html, then using the html and a gps unit attached to an iphone, the generated html was used to mark the four corners of the field. Below is a screenshot of the web application, where the user inputs tree spacing, and can place the orchard in a satellite view. For more detailed information on how to use the webapp go to https://github.com/jeekinlau/tree_visualizer     

The webapp is located here https://jeekinlau.github.io/tree_visualizer/
