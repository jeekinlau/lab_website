It has been a couple months since the last update:

## Rooted cuttings.
A quick look at some of the results we got with the softwood cuttings. Below is two pictures, on the left is a treatment that didn't do too well. And on the right there is a picture of very healthy rooting.

Rooting is half the problem. The other half is getting the rooted cuttings to grow more uniformly and create shoots that are buddable in a reasonable amount of time. After we harvested these cuttings. We potted some of them up in 1 gallon pots and are monitoring them for few months to see if they grow uniformly.
