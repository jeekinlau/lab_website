# Introduction
## About Us
The USDA-ARS peach rootstock lab is focused on developing rootstocks for the Southeastern United States. We are located in Byron, GA, at the [Fruit and Tree Nut Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/byron-ga/fruit-and-tree-nut-research/). Our aim is to develop rootstocks that are resistant or tolerant to Armillaria Root Rot (ARR) and Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL). Quantitative genetics and genomics approaches will help bolster the progress of resistance discovery and help us find solutions faster to these economically important diseases. Another focus of our lab is low-chill scion development.
