# Introduction
## Who are we
We are an USDA-ARS labratory focused on developing Peach rootstocks for the Southeastern United States. We are located in Byron, GA, at the [Fruit and Tree Nut Research Station](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/byron-ga/fruit-and-tree-nut-research/). Our aim is to develop rootstocks that which are resistant/tolerant to Armillaria Root Rot (ARR) and Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL). Quantitative genetics and genomics will help bolster the progress of resistance discovery and help us find solutions faster to these economically important diseases.
