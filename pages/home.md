# Introduction
## About Us
We are an USDA-ARS labratory focused on developing Peach rootstocks for the Southeastern United States. We are located in Byron, GA, at the [Fruit and Tree Nut Research Station](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/byron-ga/fruit-and-tree-nut-research/). Our aim is to develop rootstocks that are resistant/tolerant to Armillaria Root Rot (ARR) and Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL). Quantitative genetics and genomics approaches will help bolster the progress of resistance discovery and help us find solutions faster to these economically important diseases. Another focus of our lab is low-chill scion development.

## Armillaria Root Rot
Armillaria Root Rot (ARR) is caused by *Armillaria tabescens*, *Armillaria mellea*, and *Armillaria solidipes* [Cai et al., 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1181153/full). The fungus attacks the vascular cambium of the crown of the tree which effectively girdles the tree. In the fall, clusters of honey colored mushrooms may appear at the base of infected trees. Infected trees will have white and yellow fungal mats between the bark and wood.

Currently there is no known resistance within the domesticated peach germplasm. One interspecific hybrid between peach and plum "MP-29" was released by Dr. Beckman developed at the USDA [(Beckman et al., 2012)](https://hos.ifas.ufl.edu/media/hosifasufledu/stone-fruit/documents/varieties/mp-29-a-clonal-interspecific-hybrid-rootstock-for-peach.pdf).
