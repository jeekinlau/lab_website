## Introduction
The USDA-ARS peach rootstock lab is primarily focused on developing rootstocks for the Southeastern United States. We are located in Byron, GA, at the [Fruit and Tree Nut Research Unit](https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/byron-ga/fruit-and-tree-nut-research/). Our aim is to develop rootstocks that are resistant or tolerant to Armillaria Root Rot (ARR) and Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL). Quantitative genetics and genomics approaches will help bolster the progress of resistance discovery and help us find solutions faster to these economically important diseases. The secondary focus of the lab is moderate chill scion development.

## Focus
The lab has a wide focus of research from horticultural practices to genomics research. All with the aim of helping growers in the Southeastern United States with problems that they currently face, and anticipate facing in the future. Thus some research is focused on practical horticultural practices and other research is focused on future needs, like lower chill varieties as the Southeastern USA is accumulating less chill hours than observed historically.
