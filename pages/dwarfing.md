## Dwarfing
Many tree fruit crops have dwarfing rootstocks that allow for easier orchard management and harvesting. This allows for orchard designs like fruiting walls, and alternative plant training shapes. We are interested in creating dwarfing or rootstocks with reduced vigor to produce rootstock/scion combinations that would give growers alternative options of orchard management.
