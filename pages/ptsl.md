## Peach Tree Short Life (PTSL)

Peach tree short life results from a few different stressors on the tree that kill the tree prematurely. These stressors include ring nematode (*Mesocriconema xenoplax*) and bacterial canker. The classic symptoms is the dath of the large scaffold limbs but the rootstock sends up many suckers. 
Pictured below a tree that has died from PTSL with suckers from the rootstock (left), and one of the stressors the ring nematode (right).
