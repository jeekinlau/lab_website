## Lab History
Dr. Tom G. Beckman, the USDA-ARS rootstock breeder from year-2019 developed two broadly used rootstock used in the industry 'Guardian' (Peach Tree Short Life resistance) and 'MP-29' (Armillaria Root Rot resistance). 

## Research Projects

- Traditional breeding techniques utilizing interspecific crosses to introduce traits from other prunus species into peach germplasm
- Molecular breeding approaches utilizing markers for developing a Genomic Selection model to select for "difficult to phenotype" traits.
